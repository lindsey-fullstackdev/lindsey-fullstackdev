## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **software and support engineer** who builds and maintains systems that stand up under pressure — the same way I have in life.  
With degrees in **Computing Science (with Distinction)**, **Health Sciences**, and **Psychology**, I bring a rare mix of technical precision, human insight, and systems thinking to every project I take on.

I’ve **architected, debugged, and deployed full-stack production systems** used by real organizations — handling everything from **UI/UX and API design to system modeling, deployment, documentation, and security**. I focus on clarity, reliability, and impact — because software isn’t just code, it’s infrastructure for people’s lives.

I’m an active member of **IEEE Women in Engineering** and **IEEE Young Professionals**, and I’ve also independently built and developed technology solutions that have grown into real-world operations. My work blends technical depth with purpose — designing systems that are both human-centered and resilient.

I specialize in **React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Supabase**, but my real strength is adaptability — I can learn anything, solve anything, and deliver under real-world constraints.

> “I don’t just write code. I engineer systems that last — and I make them better when they break.”

### 💻 Engineering Philosophy
I believe great engineering is about empathy, precision, and perseverance.  
Whether I’m debugging an API, designing an interface, or re-thinking an architecture, I focus on solving root causes, writing maintainable code, and leaving things better than I found them.
