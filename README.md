## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a **software and support developer** who builds and maintains systems that hold up under pressure — the same way I have in life.  

I hold degrees in **Computing Science (with Distinction)**, **Health Sciences**, and **Psychology** — a blend that gives me both technical precision and human insight. I bring analytical thinking, empathy, and systems design together to build solutions that actually make life easier for people.

I’ve **architected, debugged, and deployed full-stack production systems** for real organizations, handling everything from **UI/UX and API design to databases, documentation, and security**. I also provide **IT support and automation solutions** for individuals and small businesses through my company, **Lifesaver Technology Services** — helping clients simplify their tech and keep things running smoothly.

I specialize in **React, TypeScript, Node.js, Supabase, and SQL**, with hands-on experience in **Python, React Native, and PHP**.  
> “I don’t just write code. I engineer systems that last — and I make them better when they break.”

### 💻 Engineering Philosophy
Great engineering starts with empathy and ends with reliability.  
Whether I’m debugging an API, automating a process, or rethinking an interface, I aim for maintainable, human-centered solutions that work in the real world. I don’t stop until the problem is solved — and if no solution exists yet, I’ll engineer one.
