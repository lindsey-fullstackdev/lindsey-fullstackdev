<h2 align="center">👋 Hey, I'm Lindsey Stead</h2>
<h3 align="center">Full-Stack Developer & Tech Support Generalist | I build things that actually work (and fix the ones that don’t).</h3>

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **full-stack developer** who does a bit of everything — software, systems, troubleshooting, and whatever it takes to make tech work for real people.  
I’ve built apps from scratch, debugged code at 2 a.m., redesigned UIs, and figured out why someone’s printer refuses to talk to their Wi-Fi. It’s all problem-solving to me.

I’ve worked across many stacks — **React, Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase, SQL, and Python** — plus **PHP and MongoDB** when the project calls for it.  
I like clean code, simple design, and building things that don’t fall apart under pressure.

I’ve also done UI/UX prototyping, user research, and full database design. Basically, if it connects to a wire or an API, I’ll make it work.  
I build software the same way I’ve built my life — with persistence, curiosity, and a sense of humor when things break.

I hold degrees in **Computing Science (with Distinction)**, **Health Sciences**, and **Psychology**. It’s an unusual mix, but it means I think like both a coder *and* a human — and it trained me to approach everything with systems thinking.

Through my small business, **Lifesaver Technology Services**, I help home users, businesses, and nonprofits with everything from IT support to automation tools and custom web or mobile software.  
I started it during my academic journey, but now I’m looking to join a **software team** where my drive, technical skills, and experience can help a company reach its goals.

Now that I’m done studying, I’m excited to join a tech company that’s building **next-gen AI tools or impactful software** — ideally in a **remote, full-time role** where I can collaborate, ship code, and keep learning. I’ll be posting more of my projects here soon as I move into this next stage.

Honestly, it takes a lot to scare me these days — and I bring that calm, people-first mindset into every problem I solve.

> “I don’t just code — I keep systems (and people) running. And if things catch fire, I’ll figure out how to put them out.”


### 💻 Engineering Philosophy
Great engineering starts with empathy and ends with reliability.  
Whether I’m debugging an API, automating a process, or rethinking an interface, I aim for maintainable, human-centered solutions that work in the real world. I don’t stop until the problem is solved — and if no solution exists yet, I’ll engineer one.
